It was decided that since tere were a lot of manufacturers of chips, the company will shift its focus on making monitors. As time passed, monitors turned to TVs and in 2004, the first Pixnet TV was launched. This turned out to be a blessing for the company and its sales and stocks sky-rocketed.</p>
